Problem Statement: Online Payments Fraud Detection with Machine Learning

Online fraud detection using machine learning is a method of identifying fraudulent activities on the internet using artificial intelligence techniques.
It involves training a machine learning model on large amounts of historical data, including examples of both fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
The model then uses this information to identify patterns and relationships in the data that are indicative of fraud.
When a new transaction is made, the model uses these patterns to make a prediction about whether the transaction is likely to be fraudulent or not.
This approach can help to reduce the number of false positive fraud alerts, while also improving the detection rate of actual fraud.

The approach followed for this problem is logistic regression.
Advantages of using logistic regression in online fraud detection include its simplicity, interpretability, and its ability to handle a large number
of input variables. However, it can also be limited by its assumption of linear relationships between the input variables and the target variable,
and may not perform well on complex and highly non-linear data.

The model was trained by using a dataset with 6.3 million entries.This made the model predict the outcomes with an accuracy of 99.9%

The future scope and usability of online fraud detection using machine learning is quite promising. 
With increasing instances of fraud and the growing volume of transactions being made online, 
the need for effective fraud detection methods is becoming more pressing. Machine learning is particularly well-suited to this task
because it can quickly identify patterns in large amounts of data and adapt to changing patterns of fraud over time.
